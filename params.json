{"name":"Android Animation for Titanium (ti-android-animation)","tagline":"Access the Honeycomb+ Animation API via Titanium","body":"Android Animation for Titanium\r\n================================\r\n\r\nQuick links:\r\n\r\n- [Project's Github Page](http://billdawson.github.com/ti-android-animation)\r\n- [Documentation][9]\r\n- [Built and Packaged (ZIP)][10]\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n============\r\n\r\nThis Titanium Android module makes the [Honeycomb (Android 3.0) animation API][1]\r\navailable to Titanium Android apps. It uses Jake Wharton's excellent\r\n[NineOldAndroids][2] library to make the animations available on pre-Honeycomb\r\ndevices as well.\r\n\r\nIt does this by wrapping and exposing two types of animators that are native to\r\nthe Honeycomb Animation API: [ObjectAnimator][3] ([native][4]) and\r\n[ViewPropertyAnimator][5] ([native][6]).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it provides access to the [AnimatorSet][7] ([native][8]), which\r\ncan run multiple `ObjectAnimator` instances either simultaneously or back-to-back.\r\n\r\nThe real star of the bunch is the `ViewPropertyAnimator`, which is the one\r\nyou should be trying to use first.\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n=============\r\n\r\nCurrently [the documentation][9] is in javadoc strings within the code and generated\r\nusing Doxygen. The result is not particularly \"Javascripty\", but I hate\r\nseparating documentation from code, so that's the way it is at least\r\nfor now.\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n=====\r\n\r\nPlease see [the documentation][9] for instructions on how to use the module in\r\nyour Titanium app. You can also find code samples under the example/ folder.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile here is a very quick example of using the view property animator made\r\navailable via this module:\r\n\r\n    var animationModule = require(\"com.billdawson.timodules.animation\");\r\n\t\r\n\t//... setup window / views ...\r\n    \r\n    animationModule.viewPropertyAnimator.animate(myView).xBy(50).yBy(50);\r\n\r\nBuild\r\n=====\r\n\r\nThe module has so far been built and tested only with Titanium 3.0.2. You build\r\nit the same as you would build any other Titanium module for Android. The build.xml\r\nAnt script is provided, but be sure your machine is setup to build Titanium\r\nAndroid modules. You can ensure this by creating and building your own test\r\nmodule using Titanium Studio. In a nutshell, you'll need the Android SDK, the\r\nAndroid NDK and Python.\r\n\r\nFull instructions on how to create and build Titanium modules for Android will\r\nnot be provided here. Nor will instructions on how to put modules in to your\r\nTitanium app projects be provided here. Look elsewhere!\r\n\r\nIf you don't wish to build but just want the packaged module, you can grab the finished\r\nproduct -- the packaged ZIP file -- also at [Github][10].\r\n\r\nDeveloped By\r\n============\r\n\r\n* Bill Dawson (http://billdawson.com)\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n=======\r\n\r\n\tThe original code herein is...\r\n\r\n\tCopyright 2013 William Dawson.\r\n\r\n\tThe NineOldAndroids library, upon which this module is built, is...\r\n\r\n    Copyright 2012 Jake Wharton.\r\n\r\n\tBoth projects:\r\n\r\n    Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\n    you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\n    You may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\r\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\n    Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\n    distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\n    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\n    See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\n    limitations under the License.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]: http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2011/02/animation-in-honeycomb.html\r\n[2]: http://nineoldandroids.com\r\n[3]: https://github.com/billdawson/ti-android-animation/blob/master/src/com/billdawson/timodules/animation/ObjectAnimator_.java\r\n[4]: http://developer.android.com/reference/android/animation/ObjectAnimator.html\r\n[5]: https://github.com/billdawson/ti-android-animation/blob/master/src/com/billdawson/timodules/animation/views/ViewPropertyAnimator_.java\r\n[6]: http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/ViewPropertyAnimator.html\r\n[7]: https://github.com/billdawson/ti-android-animation/blob/master/src/com/billdawson/timodules/animation/AnimatorSet_.java\r\n[8]: http://developer.android.com/reference/android/animation/AnimatorSet.html\r\n[9]: http://billdawson.github.com/ti-android-animation/docs/index.html\r\n[10]: http://github.com/billdawson/ti-android-animation/tree/gh-pages/packaged\r\n","google":"UA-10043994-8","note":"Don't delete this file!
